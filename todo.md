## TODO

1. Add a function for more robustly determining whether a template, when applied to a schema, will result in the narrowing down of unknown types.
2. When compiling a group constraint, ensure each constraint is only applied once.
3. Add update callbacks to structures.
4. Add specific methods and callbacks to structures for adding/removing keys, or inserting/deleting from ordered structures.
